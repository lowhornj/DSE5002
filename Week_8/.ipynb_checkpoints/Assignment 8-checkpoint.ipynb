    "Read in the two Netflix CSV files from /Data/Netflix as pandas dataframes. Print the number of unique genres. This is not as simple as it sounds. You cannot simply find the length of `titles['genres'].unique()`. You must convert the output of that code to a list, iterate over that list and replace the following characters: `[]',`. Once you have them replace you can split the individual strings to list items and flatten the list. I have already imported the `chain()` function for you to flatten the list. Look up the documentation to see its usage. There are 19 unique genres, but I want you to write the code to find them. "
